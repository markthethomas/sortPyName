#BREAKING: NOW YOU CAN...
...assign arbitrary values to names and sort them out. WOW. WHAT GREAT NEWS!

I know, I know.

Really though -- did this simple (and probably crude) bit for a programming challenge I was doing. Takes an array of names and assigns them values based on the consituent letters' positional value in the latin alphabet (a = 1, b = 1, &c.). Returns a sorted array of evaluated names, in descending order. Need to figure out which friends' names are most lexicologically large? NOW YOU CAN.
